        <h1>Our Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>
            We take privacy very seriously and that’s why we want to thank the guys from <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/" target="_blank">DuckDuckGo</a> first. This privacy policy is heavily inspired by <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/privacy" target="_blank">theirs</a>. We have created this policy to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy and to help you understand it.
        </p>
        
        <h3>First and foremost: Blippex does not collect and share your private information. We believe privacy is not a feature, but a standard and right to all web users.</h3>

        <h2>A search engine that is in your hands</h2>
        <p>
            Blippex is a search engine for and from our users. We take the browsing history data from web users using our browser extension and provide relevant results based off of their browsing habits. We give them the ability to determine how the results will appear, to do so each user will have to download the Blippex extension.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note: If you are logged into any website, we will NOT detect your personal information or credentials, but only the site’s URL itself and how long you spend on it. For example, if you are logged into Amazon.com with your username displayed, we only index that someone was on Amazon.com (the URL) and how long this person was there.
        </p>
        
        <h2>What information is stored by the extension?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The URL of the websites you visit</li>
            <li>The time you visit the website</li>
            <li>How long you spend on the website</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>We are not storing any information, that could lead to identify or track you</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Your IP address</li>
            <li>The URL of the webpage you have visited before (referer)</li>
            <li>Your browser’s <a href="http://www.whatsmyuseragent.com/" target="_blank">user agent string</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Blippex will never index a website under the following conditions:
        </h3>        
        <ul>
            <li>Indexing https encrypted sites can be enabled/disabled in the extension settings
            </li>
            <li>You are browsing in incognito/private mode</li>
            <li>The extension is disabled </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            To keep all results as relevant as possible, <strong>we will delete any results that are not been viewed in 90 days.</strong>
        </p>
        
        <h3>What information is stored if you search at blippex.org?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>We do store the search term and the time of the search, but again, not in a personally identifiable way.
            </li>
            <li>We may add an affiliate code to certain e-commerce websites. This helps us in funding our service. We are doing this by ourselves and do not use any 3rd party services to add affiliate codes.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Again, we are not storing any information that could lead to identify or track you!</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>We <strong>DO NOT</strong> use cookies on blippex.org and nothing is stored in a personally identifiable way. In the future we may provide personal Settings which will be stored in Cookies.
            </li>
            <li>We do not store your <a href="http://www.whatsmyuseragent.com/" target="_blank">user agent string</a>.
            </li>
            <li>Our service is https only, because we think that your search should always be encrypted and private. Because we only use https, other sites will not be able to detect the search terms which lead them to their site.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>The importance of transparency</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>We want to be completely open and transparent about what we do and how our system works. The Blippex extension is an open source project, so you can see all of the development work online. To do so, please <a href="https://archify.atlassian.net/wiki/display/blippexAPI/api.blippex.org" target="_blank">click here</a>.
            </li>
            <li>We will always show how many items are in our database so our users can see a realtime view of what's going on.
            </li>
            <li>Any third party developers are invited to use our Open and Anonymous API. You will never have to register to use the API and can have full access at anytime. To do so, please click here.
            </li>
            <li>Every month we will release a dump of our database and enable a download via bittorrent.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Security and Confidentiality</h3>
        <p>
            We make very strong efforts to ensure security on our systems. No data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Because of that fact, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>We use physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect personal information about you. Your information is stored securely on our servers in the European Union.
            </li>
            <li>All communication with Blippex uses industry-standard SSL-encryption.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We restrict access to personal information to archify employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process it on our behalf. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Any changes to this policy</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Blippex reserves the right to modify all or some of this Privacy Policy at any time. If we do so, we will post a notice on our website for a period of 30 days. We will use information only in accordance with the Privacy Policy under which the information was collected unless we have received explicit authorization from the appropriate user(s) to do otherwise.
            </li>
            <li>If this policy is substantively updated, we will update the text of this page and provide notice to you at blippex.com/privacy by writing '(Updated)' at the top of this Privacy Policy for a period of at least 30 days.
            </li>
